### About CraftTrove

CraftTrove was created as an alternative to Etsy, specifically targeting Indie pattern designers in textile crafts.
Independant designer can upload and manage their own patterns and sell them to their audience.
Users can collect interesting patterns in their wishlist, and after purchase, the patterns remain available in their own user-accounts.

### About the API

The API was written with JAVA in the Spring Boot framework, using Maven as build and dependency controller.
Testdata is added in a data.sql file.
